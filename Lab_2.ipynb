    "### Recap of the Naive Bayes Algorithm  {-}\n",
    "Naive Bayes classification is a fast and simple classification method. Its efficiency stems from some simplifications we make about the underlying probability distributions, namely, the assumption about the conditional independence of features. Suppose for any class $Y$, we have a probability distribution over all possible combinations of values for a feature vector $X$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X|Y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The main idea of Bayesian classification is to reverse the direction of dependence --- we want to predict the label based on the features:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y|X).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is made possible by the Bayes theorem:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(Y|X) = \\frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)}. \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more concrete, let us consider the SMS message classification problem. Ignoring punctuations, each SMS message contains an ordered sequence of $T$ words (case-insensitive) $X = \\{X_1, ...,X_T\\}$. That is, $X$ corresponds to an SMS message, and $X_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th word in it. For each message from the training set, there is a corresponding label $Y\\in\\{spam, ham\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model specification and key assumption.** The conditional distribution can be written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Since this conditional probability is intractable, we simplify it in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assume** that all features $X_i$ are independent, conditional on the category $Y$. This leads to a naive Bayes model which writes formally as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y) = \\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y). \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assume** that $P(X_i | Y) = P(X_j|Y)$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n",
    "In other words, given the label $Y$, the value of the $7$-th word has the same distribution as the value of the $10$-th word. Note this is not assumed by default in naive Bayes, and we make this additional assumption to significantly simplify our model.\n",
    "It is often referred to as \"tying\" the probability $P(X_i|Y)$ over $i$.\n",
    "As a result, the order of words no longer matters for $P(X|Y)$,\n",
    "i.e., \n",
    "$$P(X=\\text{'cat is cute'}|Y) \\ \\ = \\ \\ P(X=\\text{'cute cat is'}|Y) \\quad \\text{for all } Y.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging Eq (2) into the Bayes theorem in Eq (1), we arrive at\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "P(Y|X) &= \\frac{P(Y) P(X|Y)}{P(X)} = \\frac{P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y)}{P(X)} \\\\\n",
    "&\\propto P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y),\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",

    "**Making predictions.**\n",
    "Naturally, given an SMS message $X$, we can first compute $P(Y|X)$ for all possible categories $Y$ (in this example, only two categories), and then make predictions by outputting the $Y$ that maximizes the probability. This can be expressed mathmatically as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\arg\\max_Y P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y) = \\arg\\max_Y \\left\\{\\log P(Y) + \\sum_{i=1}^T \\log P(X_i|Y) \\right\\}. \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If there is a tie, we just break it arbitrarily.\n",
    "Here the logarithm uses natural basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning the model.**\n",
    "To apply the prediction rule in Eq (3), we need to first figure out (formally termed \"estimate\") the value of $P(Y)$ and $P(X_i|Y)$ by using the training data. Recall that since we tie the conditional probabilities $P(X_i|Y)$ across all $i$,\n",
    "the subscript $i$ can be dropped.\n",
    "However, we still carry it just for clarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, $P(Y=y)$ can be estimated by computing the frequency of category $y$ in the whole training set ($y$ can be either \"$spam$\" or \"$ham$\"). Here, in order to avoid confusion, we have used the convention that capital letters denote random variables, and lowercase letters denote their possible instantiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, $P(X_i = w |Y=y)$ for a word $w$ (e.g., \"cat\") can be estimated by counting the frequency that it appears in the training message set for a given category $y$ (derivation not required in the course):\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(X_i &= w|Y=y) \n",
    "= \\frac{Count(w, y)}{Count(y)}, \\ \\ where\n",

    "Count(y) &= \\text{total number of words appearing in SMS messages of category } y.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1:* If $w$ appears in a single message for 3 times, then it contributes to $Count(w, y)$ by 3, not 1. Similarly, $Count(y)$ indeed equals the total length of all messages in category $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2:* Obviously, the right-hand side of Eq (4) does not depend on $i$. This is consistent with our previous note that we carry the subscript $i$ in $P(X_i|Y)$ only for clarity, while in fact different $i$ share the same $P(X_i|Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose there are four messages \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{{'cat is cute', ham}, {'dog rocks', spam}, {'whatever is is right', ham}, {'hello', spam}.}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then $P(X_i = '\\text{is}' | \\text{ham}) = 3 / 7$ (**not** $2/7$),\n",
    "and $P(X_i = '\\text{is}' | \\text{spam}) = 0 / 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quiz (no need to submit): compute $P(X_i = w | \\text{ham})$, for $w = $ 'cat', 'is', 'cute', 'whatever', and 'right'. Check if their sum is 1. Now appreciate why in Remark 1, a word appearing for mulitple times in a single message should be counted multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that any word $w$ with $Count(w,y)=0$ leads to $P(X_i = w|Y=y) = 0$.\n",
    "As a result, by Eq (2), any message $x$ has conditional probably $P(X = x |Y=y) = 0$ if $w$ appears in $x$.\n",
    "Such a \"veto\" is not favorable, and can create significant problems when a word in the test data has never appeared in the training data (think why?).\n",
    "To bypass this issue, we can add pseudo-count, a.k.a additive smoothing:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{P}(X_i = w|Y=y) = \\frac{Count(w, y) + \\alpha}{Count(y) + N\\alpha}, \\tag{5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a smoothing parameter. $\\alpha=0$ corresponds to no smoothing. In our experiment, let us set $\\alpha = 1.0$. $N$ denotes the number of distinct words in the vocabulary, and let us set $N = 20,000$ in this lab.\n",

Therefore, accuracy is not a good metric in this case for evaluating the performance of the classifier. As we did before, we can use F-score metrics.

    "Different from classification models, a regression model is used to predict real values rather than the category an example belongs to. Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between features and real value target. To perform supervised learning, we represent the hypothesis as a linear function of features ($x$) to predict the output ($y$).\n",

    "To simplify the notation and ease the computation, we **pad** the input $x$ by letting $x_0=1$. That is, for an example with three features $x=[x_1, x_2, x_3]$, the padded feature vector will be $x=[1,x_1, x_2, x_3]$. Then, the linear function can be written as:\n",

You will see the results of running autogrder once you submit your code. If you see 'test `function_name` completed', it means your function is execuable; otherwise please follow the error messages to debug. Since those simple test cases are designed for debugging, it does notguaranttee your solution will work well on real dataset. It is your responsibility to make your code logically correct.\n",
